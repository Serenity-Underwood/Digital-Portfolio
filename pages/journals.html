                    <u>(Software) Development Engineers</u> are people within the team that design and program the code for the software. They must also maintain and clean the code to ensure it’s functional and in working order. These people have knowledge in programming languages for development of the software.                   
                    </li>

                    <u>QA Engineers</u> are similar to (Software) Development Engineers because both roles or jobs need knowledge in programming languages, but QA Engineers differ in the fact that they carry the task of debugging the software. QA stands for quality assurance. This means that they make certain/sure the software is functioning and functioning correctly and efficiently in its tasks. They typically debug and report on runned tests, but they can also look at performance tests which helps run the software smoothly with little trouble and data used.

                    <u>Project Managers</u> is the leader of the team who makes, organizes, and manages the project and Team Members. They make sure that the project is within the scope of time and budget, and they help Team Members in case they are given too many tasks or need better time slots to productively work on the project. They are the ones who will overview the entirety of the process and see how the team is working efficiently.

                    <u>Product Managers</u> are similar to Project Managers, but they overlook the product rather than the project for the most part. They identify the needs of the project and the objectives needed to finish or complete an issue. They help manage the Team Members by giving them tasks.

                    Technical challenges that I have faced at the end of this week are getting Tabby and Github running and setting up my Digital Portfolio and Journals. It has been a bit of a challenge to get to where I am now, but I had help from Team Members. One thing that I have to get used to is the emacs and CoderMerlin. I used the shell and Visual Studio Code at home, and although it’s basically the same concept, I’m still having trouble adjusting. I need to work around the ecosystem to understand.                          
                    </li>                                                          
                    <li class="entry scheduling-challenges">                       
                    Some scheduling challenges that have happened would be the switch from Computer Science I to Computer Science II and trying to keep up with my Team Members. Everything has been confusing, but I am starting to get into the groove of what to do and what my role is. I’m not great at time management, but I would be working over the weekend to get research for facial recognition in the Python libraries completed and work on the next issue.              
                    </li>                                                          
                    <li class="entry interpersonal-challenges">                    
                    An interpersonal challenge would be the unfamiliarities of my Team Members. Most of them are quite helpful and friendly, but I feel slightly uncomfortable with not knowing their expectations for me. I don’t want to disappoint them, so I’m going to do all my tasks before the deadline effectively and efficiently.             
                    </li>                                                          
                    </ul>                                                            
                </li>     
                <li class="date">                                                  
                    <ul>                                                             
                    <li>January 20, 2023</li>                                      
                    <li class="entry technical-challenges">                        
                    A technical challenge would be establishing issues and commenting on said issues on the GitHub repository. This would be my first time working on GitHub with other people and my first time experiencing making issues and commenting on Team Member’s issues. I’m sure that the more I experience issues and create discussions based on issues, the easier it will be to work with them.    
                    </li>                                                          
                    <li class="entry scheduling-challenges">                       
                    A scheduling issue was that we were brainstorming and organi\
                    k on the product much at all. This could be deemed as an issue because if we take too long figuring out portions of the product and roles of Team Members, it would lead to unproductivity and an inefficient use of time that could be used for the project. However, it seemed like this was a buffer period of the new school year, and it helped me adjust to my Team Members better.     
                    </li>                                                          
                    <li class="entry interpersonal-challenges">                    
                    An interpersonal challenge is the inability to be more vocal. I tend to have a problem with not asking for help or voicing out opinions and thoughts, and in the end, I feel like I’m contributing very little for the Team. I can refocus my inner thoughts, and strive to discuss more with Team Members and understand any of their ideas that they shared with me.

                <li class="date">

                <li class="entry technical-challenges">     
                A technical challenge would be viewing my code from Tabby/Guacamole. I’m essentially blind on the terminal and I don’t know what the code appears to be, so I have doubts it looks the way it should look. My Team Members have told me to use Visual Studio Code on a personal computer, so I am working with that for now. The other problem I have for that would be copying and pasting it to my terminal emacs, and it seems like a tedious process. In conclusion, I will either ask the professor if there is a way to view it, ask my Team Members to establish GitHub pages, or use an outside resource such as CodePen to view it (but this would be very much similar to the VS Code problem I have).

                A technical challenge that keeps occurring for me would be pushing my commits to one of the branches in our ISP GitHub repository. Even though I have pulled from both the origin and frontend branch of the repository, it still says “error” whenever I try to push. The first time it had done this, Project Manager and Release Manager were able to push my commits. To troubleshoot this issue, I will probably have to ask them again for assistance.

                I haven’t done as much work as my Front End Team Members, but I am working on the Select Class Page and attempting to make it sImilar to the plan. However, it seems that my Front End Team Leader is doing a bit more, and I would like to ask him his plans and see if I can do another page to even out the workload. Furthermore, I won’t be able to work on the ISP Project as much during my Spring Break.

                I am not having much difficulty with my Team Members. I am not as vocal as I should be, but I made more progress throughout the time that we have been working together. One major challenge, however, is asking for help. I don’t really ask for help, and my poor performance shows the lack of it.
